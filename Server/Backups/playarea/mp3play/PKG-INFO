Description: 
        ------------
        mp3play
        ------------
        
        Allows your Windows Python program to play and stop MP3s, without opening
        an external player or requiring any external programs.  A very simple
        interface for the common case (playing an entire MP3), with an API for
        more complex tasks (e.g. playing from seconds 30 to 45 of an MP3).
        
        Note: if you are looking for complex cross-platform audio control, try
        pyglet.  After easy_installing pyglet, it requires a separate manual
        installation of AVlib libraries, which is why I wrote mp3play as an
        easy_installable alternative.
        
        Example
        =======
        
        Play the first 30 seconds of a file::
        
        import mp3play
        
        filename = r'C:\Documents and Settings\Michael\Desktop\music.mp3'
        clip = mp3play.load(filename)
        
        clip.play()
        
        import time
        time.sleep(min(30, clip.seconds()))
        clip.stop()
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        Requires Windows XP at the moment, but the goal is to make a
        cross-platform module.  Feel free to send patches to add Linux and
        Mac support!  Note that the module's purpose is to be easy_installable
        with no other work needed by the user, so things like AVLib are out unless
        that can be easy_installed automatically alongside mp3play.

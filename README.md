Raspberry Pi Audio Control

Very much so, a work in progress. There will be changes and commits often, till the end of December 2014, then they may taper off a bit.

The goal of this project is to create a music server on a raspberry pi, that will be connected to a car stereo system. Though any device that has auxiliary input, will be able to play the audio, it is being designed for the car, foremost. Initially I am developing an Android app to interface with the server, but I would like to create an iOS app as well.
